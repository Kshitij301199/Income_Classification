# IDA-ML-1 Income Groups Project
This repository holds the final project submission for the course "Intelligent Data Analysis and Machine Learning 1" offered during the SOSE23 at the Universität Potsdam.
# Problem Setting
A polling institute wants to be able to estimate an individual’s income from his/her personal data (see einkommen.train). To this aim, 30.000 individuals were interviewed concerning the features summarized below. For some of the individuals, not all features are
available. Crucially, the income of only 5,000 of the interviewee’s is known.
We are tasked to train machine learning models to predict the income catergory in which the 25,000 individuals fall.
